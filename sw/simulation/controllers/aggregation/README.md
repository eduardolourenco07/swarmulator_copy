# aggregation

## Description
This controller implements an aggregation behavior as was used in:

**"The PageRank algorithm as a method to optimize swarm behavior through local analysis"**.
*Mario Coppola, Jian Guo, Eberhard Gill, Guido de Croon, 2019.*
Swarm Intelligence, December 2019, Volume 13, Issue 3–4, pp 277–319

The paper is available open-access at this link:

The behavior is similar to the one, though, due to the evolutions of Swarmulator since then, it may differ slightly. For the exact same behavior as in the paper, plese see the `SI_pagerank` branch of the repository.

It is designed to work with the "particle" agent.
